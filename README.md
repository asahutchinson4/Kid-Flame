# Kid-Flame
My first full unity game called Kid Flame. I started this project second semester of my sophomore year of college. I finished it the next summer.

# Overview of Project
I started this project for my foundations of game development course. Our goal was to incorporate what we had learned into a playable game. My classmates nor I were able to finish our games given our time limit so I continued the project throughout the summer. My goal was to create a game on my own that could be completed with the basic aspects found in games played today. I did not create the border for the karma meter, my school advisor, Dr. Branton, helped me with parts of the health system and all the sound from the game was downloaded off the internet. Everything else was created and thought of by me.  While taking two online classes and working out/practicing basketball for my University, I exhibited my passion, discipline and eagerness to learn by giving this project countless hours of my freetime. 

# Backstory/Story
Kid Flame is a 2D platformer where you play as Felix Nicks, a 10 year old boy that goes out shopping with his father. As Felix waited for his father, Judas Nicks, in the car for hours, the car continually got hotter and Felix's body couldn't take it anymore. His skin bursted into flames which began his mutation into Kid Flame. The goal of the game is to find your father and decide what to do with his life.

# What I Learned
I learned a lot about different concepts of game development such as scriptable objects, particle systems, UI, prefabs, and so much more. I got a lot better at coding in the language C# and working in the Unity Engine. But more importantly, I learned how to problem solve and be persistent. Sometimes I would be trying to work through a problem for 10+ hours and I would never give up on it. I would try to figure out all the places the problem could be, isolate it and then attempt to fix it. If it did not work then I would move to the next potential location of the problem. I would become obsessive over my game's problems and would not stop until it was fixed. I also learned about myself in this process. I learned how determined I am and how passionate I am about making games. To anyone else, this might sound like a miserable grind but to me this was an incredible experience that I look fondly upon.

# Contributors
My only contributor was my school advisor, Dr. Branton. One of the hardest parts of this project was learning how to use scriptable objects for the health system. I spent a lot of time trying to make this work, but was not able to to do it on my own. I reached out to Dr. Branton for help and he was a big reason why I was able to do it. 

# Build
If you try to build this game you will not be able to play it unless you are on a 32 inch monitor. This was an enormous learning experience for me and as a result I foolishly set the canvas of my main menu to constant pixel size. In the future, I will definitely make the canvas scale to the player's screen size but for now this is the limitation.
